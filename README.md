**Minitalk: Signaling Data Exchange! 📡**

Unlock the power of UNIX signals with Minitalk! This project challenges you to build a small data exchange program using **signals**. As you delve into the world of signal handling, you'll create a client and server that communicate seamlessly through the magic of **SIGUSR1** and **SIGUSR2** signals. Get ready to master this unique form of data transfer! 🚀🔌


**Project Accomplishment Summary 🎉**

In this project, you've successfully implemented a **client and server communication system** using UNIX signals. The server, when started, displays its **PID**, while the client sends a specified string to the server. The server promptly receives and prints the string, ensuring efficient and rapid communication. You've learned the ins and outs of signal handling and created a reliable data exchange mechanism. With **Minitalk**, you're now equipped to handle signal-based communication like a pro! 📢💬


**Conclusion 🧩**

Minitalk provides a fascinating glimpse into the world of **UNIX signals**, offering a unique perspective on interprocess communication. By mastering signal handling and building a functional **client-server system**, you've added a valuable skill to your programming toolkit. As you continue your coding journey, the knowledge gained from this project will serve you well in tackling more complex tasks and understanding the intricacies of signal-driven applications. Cheers to successful signaling! 🌐👩‍💻
